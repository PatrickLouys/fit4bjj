title: The Offseason
---

If you want to be a serious competitive athlete, you need to plan your training like a professional. If you just train hard and compete constantly, it is very easy to burn out both physically and mentally.

There is a good reason why pretty much every sport has a season and an offseason. In jiu jitsu there are tournaments year round. You have to create your own season and offseason according to your own goals and tournament schedule.

## The purpose of the offseason

In the middle of your competition season, small and not so small injuries tend to stack up over time. If you are like most athletes, you won't take time off to let them heal so the training and competition injuries add up over time.

During the offseason you can reduce both training intensity and volume and give your body time to heal.

It is a great time to work on body composition. Do you have to go up or down a weight class? Use your offseason to focus on gaining or losing weight.

Instead of just working your A-game, use the time to explore new areas and add new things to your game for the coming season.

## Scheduling your offseason

Try to find at least 3 months of the year for your offseason. If your main focus is the gi, right after worlds is a good time.
You can also try to fit in one or more mini-offseasons into the year. Even just a block of a few weeks can do a lot if you have a long break between two big tournaments.

## Planning your offseason

The end of a season and beginning of an offseason is a great time to review and plan your training and goals.

Don't just jump into it though right after you walk off the mats at worlds. Take a week or two off and don't think about the sport too much. After all your hard training of last season you deserve a break.

Start your offseason by making a plan for the upcoming season. 

Review your long term goals. Make goals for the season. What kinds of athlete do you have to be to achieve your long term and season goals?

Think about what attributes you have to improve to reach your goals. Do you need to go up or down a weight class? Do you have to get stronger? Add more muscle? Get more lean? Improve your cardio?

Write down a primary and secondary goal for your offseason. Even if you might not reach your goals completely in the offseason, you should be able to make good progress towards them.

During offseason, your jiu jitsu training will be prioritized lower than your rehab and physical training. In season, jiu jitsu is the main focus and your strength and conditioning should not interfere too much with your jiu jitsu. During offseason, it's the other way around. Your jiu jitsu training should not interfere too much with your strength and conditioning.

It is always much easier to maintain an adaption (like added muscle mass for example) compared to building it. Build (or build back up) your physical attributes during offseason and then maintain them as good as possible during the season.

During the season jiu jitsu can become a bit boring sometimes. You are focused on your A-game playing the same positions all the time. Use the offseason to explore new positions and expand your game.

The offseason is a great time to study instructionals and study matches. While you should also do that during season, the focus during the season should be on your A-game and you should study the competitors in your weight class (or adjacent to it). In the offseason, have a look at what people much heavier or lighter than you are doing. Study the legends of the sport and go through their matches. You might find some things that you can add to your game.
