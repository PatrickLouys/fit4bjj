title: Cardiac Power Intervals
---

This training method uses high intensity intervals to increase the strength of the heart and it's ability to transport oxygen at high intensities. It results in a higher oxygen utilization (VO2 max).

Your VO2 max is mostly genetic. You can improve it through training, but only by a certain amount (Prud'homme et al. 1984). You should only use it for 5-15% of your total training load (Neumann et al. 2000, p. 81).

Your VO2 max can be improved through high intensity intervals (Helgerud et al. 2007). We are going to use <b>3-6 rounds of 3 minutes</b>. You want to get up to your <b>maximum heart rate</b> as fast as possible and then keep it there until the round ends (Neumann et al. 2000, p. 146). <b>Rest 3 minutes between rounds</b>.

You have to really push yourself during the rounds. You should not just be tired at the end of a round, but really exhausted.

Sparring doesn't work for this method, it's impossible to keep up the required pace during normal sparring. We can use high-intensity situational sparring drills instead. Use a different scenario for each round.

Here are some scenarios that work well:

- Open guard passing
- Wrestling from a single leg position
- Escaping from side control, person on top stays mobile

You can get as creative as you want with the scenarios, as long as they require a high energy output and a fast pace. 

Whenever the action slows down, reset and start over. You should never rest in a position, no matter how tired you are.
