Most people that are not serious competitor only start worrying about their fitness level when a competition is coming up. They let themselves get out of shape in between tournaments and so their progress is a constant up and down.

You can't let yourself get out of shape if you want to perform at your best. Developing a lot of the important training adaptions takes time and just a few months before a competition is not enough.

Tournament preparation should only be the cherry on top of your regular training. If you spend more time working on your general fitness, more long-term improvements will happen. The focus should be on the aerobic system and strength training, since those two have most room for improvement and developing them takes a lot of time.

Most of your training time should be spent by using the [cardiac output method](/cardiac-output-method). If your resting heart rate is below 60 beats per minute (taken in the morning, lying down), add 1-2 [threshold training](/threshold-training) sessions per week to the mix. Keep the ratio between the cardiac output method and threshold training at least 3 to 1.

You can add 2-3 [strength training](/strength-training) sessions per week on top, but don't even think about skipping a BJJ lesson for strength training unless you train multiple times per day already.

Training like this is very good for learning and improving your technique. With the threshold training there is a higher intensity training that helps you uncover holes in your game, but most of the time should be spent on improving your technique. The aerobic system will be improved as a side-effect of your technique work if you plan your training accordingly.

The strength training is useful for improving your performance and preventing injuries, but don't let it cut into your technique training. Spending more time on technique will reap a greater reward than working on strength in the long term.

Schedule your strength training sessions before any intensive BJJ trainings. Don't do a hard threshold training the day before your strength training.
